# Phase 5-7 Implementation Verification

## Frontend Timeline Booking Experience
- `RB_Assets_Manager` conditionally enqueues the modern booking bundle alongside the dedicated timeline stylesheet/script and exposes location + string data to the browser so the widget can render slots in context.【F:includes/class-assets-manager.php†L47-L147】
- The new multi-step booking controller wires up modal behaviour, language switching, and timeline integration events so availability checks transition seamlessly into the confirmation step.【F:assets/js/new-booking.js†L9-L377】
- Timeline-specific JavaScript populates time slots from location settings, computes checkout/cleanup windows, and surfaces availability or suggestions with inline messaging hooks for the main flow.【F:assets/js/timeline-booking.js†L4-L385】
- The accompanying CSS delivers the responsive layout, highlight states, and alternative-time buttons used in the enhanced form.【F:assets/css/timeline-booking.css†L1-L214】

## AJAX Enhancements & Availability Logic
- Admin-side AJAX routes provide timeline data retrieval, table status updates, and extended availability checks (including alternative suggestions) with nonce and capability validation.【F:includes/class-ajax.php†L397-L569】
- The frontend AJAX handler returns computed checkout and cleanup times so the widget can preview schedule impacts before submission.【F:public/class-frontend-public.php†L407-L441】

## Localization Coverage
- Vietnamese, English, and Japanese translation packs ship timeline phrases such as availability messages, duration hints, and cleanup guidance to keep the experience localized across markets.【F:languages/vi_VN/translations.php†L83-L141】【F:languages/en_US/translations.php†L120-L140】【F:languages/ja_JP/translations.php†L110-L140】

All timeline-focused frontend capabilities from Phases 5-7 are implemented, localized, and ready for integration with earlier phases.
